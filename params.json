### One Tool to find them all
  
BioFragmentor is a python based tool for doing /in silico/ fragmentation of biomolecules, such as RNA, DNA or proteins. Due to the 
usage of external XML datafiles, the number of supported sequence types can easily be extended to other polymers abiding to a few 
simple rules, such as beeing linear or having the same ligation handle (like a amide group) between them.
